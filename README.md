## Description
BandVisualizer is a web application designed to display detailed information about bands and artists using a given API. The application retrieves data on artists, their concert locations, dates, and relationships between these elements to present a cohesive and interactive user experience. The project emphasizes creating a user-friendly interface that effectively visualizes this information using various formats such as blocks, cards, tables, lists, pages, and graphs.

The application allows users to interact with the data through events and actions that trigger server communication, ensuring dynamic and up-to-date information display. The backend is developed in Go, adhering to best practices, ensuring robustness, and avoiding crashes.
